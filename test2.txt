keyword -  refers to the  inbuilt/pre-defined words which has some meaning in java .
          there are 50+3 java keywords in java 
    they are -
    1)the 8 primitive datatypes - byte ,short,int,long,double,float,boolean,char
    2)public - it is an access modifier which define the type of access the class has.
    3)static - it is a keyword used to create vaiables and methods which belong to a class rather than a particular instance of a class.
    4)void - it is a return type keyword which is used there is no value to return.
    5)if- it is an keyword used to use a conditional statement.
    6)for - keyword used to call a for loop.
    7)switch - keyword used to call switch operator.
    8)class	- used to call a class in java.
	9)true- keyword used as boolean default value.
	10)null - keyword used as String default value.
	
	
	
	
	VARIABLE - a registered memory location used to store data.
	           a container use to store data/value for further use in java program.
			   syntax - datatype variableName = value;
			   
			   there are 4 types of variables 
			   1) local variable - it is used inside a main or any other method to storfe a value.
			                       its scope is limited to that method only.
								   
			   2) static variable - it is used inside class and outside instance.
			                        the variable is declared with static keyword.
			   3) instance variable - the variable is declared without  static keyword inside the class .
			   4) parameter varable - it is declared in the method variable and acts as a variable inside an method.
			                          A parameter variable is passed with its corresponding arguments.
			   
							example - class PriceUpdate {
							              static int price;
							              public static int addPrice( price){
										      int newPrice = price+1;
											  return newPrice;
										  }
										 public static void main (String newAddition[]){
										 
										   addPrice(120);
										   System.out.println(newPrice);
										 }
										  }
					
Primitive datatype - 
      they are basic data types provided by the java  and are used to represent simple values.
	  their sizes are already defined.
      it have default values given by java (0 for datatype which stores numbers, false for boolean, space for char )
      example - int, char, float,long,short,boolean,double,byte.
Non-primitive datatype - 
      Also known as reference types and are more complex and are derived from primitive types.
	  their sizes can be varied according to user need .
      it have default values given by java (null).
	  example - Array,String,class,instance.

   


 identifiers - any name given to the variable in the source code is called identifiers.
             example - className, main, System, out, println 
 keywords -  keywords are pre-defined / built-in words which has some meaning.
             Total keywords are: 50 + 3.  
            3 keywords which are considered as values(true ,false,null).
 Literals - values assigned to the variables is called as literals.
 Arrays -  which is used to store more than one value of similar datatype in a single varable. 
 Methods - A block of code /code snippet used to perform a certain functionalites.
 
 
 
 MethodOverloding -  more than one method of similar methodName with different parameters are present inside a single class  is refered as method overloding.
                     
					
 
 for loop goes in infinate loop when 
   1) when terminal condition  always remains true'
   2) terminal condition is not specified 
   
   example - for (i=0;i<5;i--){
   
   }
   
   main method - it is a behaviour of a class.
                 syntax - <access modifier> return type main (String ArrayName[]){
				            }   
                        example - public static void main(String args[])]
